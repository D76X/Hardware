> Truth Table to Boolean Algorithm

To convert any truth table into a Boolean expression, always follow these three steps:

1) Map to a K map
- Create one K map per output column
- Choose the K map for it's number of inputs

2) Group and circle the 1s and Xs

Step two is where the simplification happens. 
The goal is to circle all of the original 1s in a way that follows these rules:

1) Use the fewest circles possible.
2) Make each circle as large as possible.
3) Only group horizontally or vertically, never diagonally.
4) Each group must contain a power of two squares: 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16.
5) It is possible to form groups accross the borders of the table.
6) Groups can intersect each other even on Xs.

- Circle all 1s (you may include Xs to make larger groups)
- Use the fewest groups possible
- Make groups as large as possible
- No diagonal grouping
- Group sizes must be 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16

Note: Technically, rules 1 and 2 are not required to get a correct expression, but they are what give you the most simplified expression. Also, you can never circle Os, but you can include Xs if it helps to satisfy the four conditions.


3) Convert groups into terms: generate boolean expressions from the circles

For each circle, build a mini table and generate one term. 
Then add all terms together to form the final expression.
The terms are added together (ORed together).

1) Top row: inputs, in the same order as the original truth table.

2) Bottom row: the binary indices of the K map squares inside the circle.

3) Extract the term using these rules:
- if an input changes, drop it
- if an input is all 1s, keep it
- if an input is all Os, keep it inverted

Each circle produces one Boolean term
- Build a mini table for each circle:
Top row: input variables, same order as the truth table
Bottom row: indices of the K map squares inside the circle
Extract the term from the table:
⚫ changes in a column → drop that variable
all 1s keep the variable
all Os keep the variable inverted
- Add all terms together with plus to get the final expression

## K-Maps

[Standard K-Maps (Karnaugh Maps)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnaugh_map)  
[Introduction Of K Map Karnaugh Map - How to create a K Map](https://sathee.iitk.ac.in/article/computer/introduction-of-k-map-karnaugh-map/)  
[Ep 040: Introduction to Karnaugh Maps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPHxpiJfyS8&t=35s)  

Standard K-Maps (Karnaugh Maps) are graphical tools for simplifying Boolean logic expressions, acting like a 2D truth table with cells representing **minterms (or maxterms)** for 2, 3, 4, or more variables (n), using \(2^{n}\) cells in a grid, typically with Gray code labeling, to visually group '1's (or '0's) into powers-of-two-sized blocks (1, 2, 4, 8...) to find the most minimal Sum-of-Products (SOP) or Product-of-Sums (POS) expression. They provide a systematic way to reduce logic gates needed for digital circuits, avoiding complex Boolean algebra, especially for 3-4 variables where they are most effective. 

A Karnaugh map reduces the need for extensive calculations by **taking advantage of humans' pattern-recognition capability**.
A Karnaugh map (K-map) is a **graphical method** used to simplify Boolean expressions. It is a **two-dimensional representation** of **the truth table of a Boolean function**, and **it allows for the identification of common terms that can be factored out**.

> How to Create a Karnaugh Map

To create a Karnaugh map, follow these steps:

- Write the truth table of the Boolean function.
- Group the rows of the truth table according to the values of the first two variables.
- Group the columns of the truth table according to the values of the last two variables.
- Fill in the cells of the Karnaugh map with the values of the Boolean function from the truth table.
- Identify the common terms in the Karnaugh map.
- Factor out the common terms to simplify the Boolean expression.
