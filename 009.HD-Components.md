# Polyfuse - PPTC (Polymeric Positive Temperature Coefficient)

A polyfuse is a **resettable, self-healing circuit protection component used to prevent damage from overcurrent** faults in electronics. Unlike traditional, one-time fuses, polyfuses automatically reset to a low-resistance 
state once they cool down and the fault is removed.
