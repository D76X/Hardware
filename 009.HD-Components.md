# Polyfuse - PPTC (Polymeric Positive Temperature Coefficient) aka PolySwitch or Resettable PTC. 

A polyfuse is a **resettable, self-healing circuit protection component used to prevent damage from overcurrent** faults in electronics. 
Unlike traditional, one-time fuses, polyfuses automatically reset to a low-resistance state once they cool down and the fault is removed. 

Unlike traditional fuses, they do not require replacement; they increase in resistance during a fault, cutting off current, and 
automatically reset once they cool down. 

- Key Characteristics and Functionality:
Self-Resetting: When overcurrent occurs, the conductive polymer inside the polyfuse heats up and changes from a crystalline 
to an amorphous structure, dramatically increasing its resistance and stopping the current. Once the fault is cleared and 
the component cools, it returns to a low-resistance state.

- Material: Made of a conductive polymer mixed with carbon particles, acting as a PTC resistor.

- Applications: 
Widely used in computers (USB port protection), battery packs, speakers, and consumer electronics to protect against short circuits and overloads.

- Limitations: T
hey are not instantaneous; they require time to heat up and trip, and they are generally used in low-voltage, low-current applications.  

> Advantages Over Traditional Fuses:

- Reusable: No need for replacement after a fault.
- Design Flexibility: Small, compact size allows for placement near sensitive components.
- Reliability: Long life cycle for repetitive, temporary faults.
