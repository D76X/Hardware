## Look-Up Tables (LUTs)

[Lesson 4: Tutorial – Performing Boolean Algebra inside an FPGA using Look-Up Tables (LUTs)](https://nandland.com/lesson-4-what-is-a-look-up-table-lut/)  
[Boolean Algebra And LUTs in FPGA nandland 56.4k subscribe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Usoo2j2TQio)  

As was mentioned in the beginning of this article, discrete logic gates do not actually exist inside of an FPGA. 
The way that FPGAs are able to do Boolean algebra is by using Look-Up Tables (LUTs). 

A Look-Up Table is a discrete block of functionality that can be programmed by the Digital Designer. 
LUTs use the same truth table concept to relate outputs to inputs. 

The LUT is programmed by the Digital Designer to perform a Boolean algebra equation. 
As you might expect, all possible combinations of boolean expressions need to be able to be programmed into the Look-Up Table.

One 3-Input LUT can make any Boolean algebra equation you can think of using 3 input signals. 
In modern FPGAs 4-Input and even 5-Input LUTs are common. 

Note to the reader: many textbooks and classrooms will spend a significant amount of time discussing how LUTs can be wired to **create the optimal solution to a Boolean expression**. 

**Optimal means that it uses the least number of gates possible**. 

Topics such as:

- De Morgan’s Law
- Karnaugh Maps 
- The Quine-McCluskey method

and others are usually discussed at great length that describe how to optimize digital logic. However I feel that this is not necessary to begin learning about FPGAs. With the intent of getting you programming an FPGA as soon as possible I will skip these topics. Perhaps some day I will write about them so that if a student needs an outside reference they can read more here, but for now I will stick to what I believe is the minimal amount of knowledge necessary to start with FPGA design.

# What is a Flip-Flop? 

[What is a Flip-Flop? How are they used in FPGAs? nandland](https://nandland.com/lesson-5-what-is-a-flip-flop/)  
[Lesson 5: Tutorial – How Flip-Flops Work in FPGAs](https://nandland.com/lesson-5-what-is-a-flip-flop/)   

Any data storage elements are known as either: 

- sequential logic:  it operates on the transitions of a clock. 
When a Flip-Flop sees a rising edge of the clock, it registers the data from the Input D to the Output Q.

- registered logic

Why are D-Flip-Flop so crucial to digital design?

- Flip-flops are the main component in an FPGA that is used to keep the state inside of the chip.

[Using Process (in VHDL) or Always Block (in Verilog) with Clocks](https://nandland.com/tutorial-sequential-code-on-your-fpga/)  

Processes (vhdl) or Always Blocks (Verilog) are used in two main scenarios:

1. To define a block of combinational logic
2. To define a block of sequential logic
