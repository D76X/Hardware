- On board PWR Supply
- USB Port for Programming & Debugging

## Block Diagram of the design

1. Power Supply: 

- the PCB needs stable power 
- use an AC to DC converter to bring down the mains voltage to a safe DC level
- the safe DC level feeds into the Power Supply Block (PSB) that distributes regulated voltage to the other parts of the PCB
- A Low Dropout (LDO) regulator compoment is used to supply with power all the sensitive components such as the Microcontroller, the RTC anD the switches  

Additional Notes:

A Real-Time Clock (RTC) is an integrated circuit that functions as a battery-backed, low-power digital clock, keeping accurate time (hours, minutes, seconds) and date even when the main system power is off. It uses a 32.768 kHz quartz crystal to ensure precise timing for applications like computers, servers, and IoT devices, often communicating via I2C or SPI interfaces. 

Key Features and Functions of a RTC: 

Persistent Timekeeping: Continues to track time during power failures or when the system is in low-power mode, typically powered by a small coin-cell battery.

Components: Contains a controller, oscillator, and quartz crystal resonator.

Low Power Consumption: Operates in the microampere (\(\mu A\)) or nanoampere (\(nA\)) range, ideal for battery-operated devices.

Common Use Cases: Used in IoT devices, smart meters, industrial PLCs, and computers for timestamping data and scheduling operations.

Alternatives: While modern systems can use internet time, RTCs remain essential for standalone, offline timekeeping. 

Common RTC ICs include the DS1307, DS3231, and Epson RX8111CE.

2. AC to DC converter

- brings down the mains voltage to a safe DC level
- the safe DC level output of the AC-DC converter is used as input of a DC Power Block to generate a regulated DC voltage to distribute to the rest of the board 

---

3. LDO [Low-Dropout Regulator]

- the safe DC level output of the AC-DC converter is also fed into a LDO to generate at its output a noise-free DC level used to power noise-sensitove components suche as RTC, switches, some FPGA, some Microcontrollers, etc.

5. Processing Unit

This is normally a microcontroller or an FPGA.
