> What is a Polyfuse - PPTC (Polymeric Positive Temperature Coefficient) ?

A polyfuse is a **resettable, self-healing circuit protection component used to prevent damage from overcurrent** faults in electronics. Unlike traditional, one-time fuses, polyfuses automatically reset to a low-resistance 
state once they cool down and the fault is removed.

Features

- LED & Sound Feedback
- Push Buttons for manual operation
- Real time clock (RTC)
- Remote Control (Gen-Al or Cloud)
- On board PWR Supply
- USB Port for Programming & Debugging

## Block Diagram of the design

1. Power Supply: 

- the PCB needs stable power 
- use an AC to DC converter to bring down the mains voltage to a safe DC level
- the safe DC level feeds into the Power Supply Block (PSB) that distributes regulated voltage to the other parts of the PCB
- A Low Dropout (LDO) regulator compoment is used to supply with power all the sensitive components such as the Microcontroller, the RTC anD the switches.

---

2. AC to DC converter

- brings down the mains voltage to a safe DC level
- the safe DC level output of the AC-DC converter is used as input of a DC Power Block to generate a regulated DC voltage to distribute to the rest of the board 

---

3. LDO [Low-Dropout Regulator]

- the safe DC level output of the AC-DC converter is also fed into a LDO to generate at its output a
noise-free DC level used to power noise-sensitove components suche as RTC, switches, some FPGA, 
some Microcontrollers, etc.  

---

4. INPUT Devices

- RTC
- switches

---

5. Processing Unit

This is normally a microcontroller or an FPGA.
